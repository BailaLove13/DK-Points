<h1>Points Key</h1>
<UL>
	<li>Each time you get a source you get a point</li>
	<li>Each time you outreach you get a point</li>
	<li>Each time you get an interview you get 5 points</li>
</UL>
<p>If you reach a goal you get 10 more points, or for interviews you'll get 15. If you reach your goal for them all, you'll get 20 extra points. The earlier you get them in, the more points you will get. Like if you get it all done on a Wednesday, you'll get 5 extra points. But, if you get it done on a Friday, you don't get extra points.

<p>Now, you may be asking, "What can these points do?" well that's what I'm gonna tell you! You can buy thins from this little store down here. If you want to add anything you can ask my mom through slack, and just say something like, "Add {thing} to the store" and I probably will. The items available are right here, and the stuff that's adding things to avatars will be done through Photoshop, because I can do that. I don't have many ideas for this so, if you want anything I bet it would be added. OK, onto the shop.</p>
